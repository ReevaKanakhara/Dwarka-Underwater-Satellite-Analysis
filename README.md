## 🔍 Overview
This research explores the use of **Remote Sensing** and **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** to identify potential submerged archaeological features near the coast of Dwarka, Gujarat. This study was presented at the **National Conference on IoT (NCIOT-2025)**.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Tech Stack
* **Platform**: Google Earth Engine (GEE) for cloud-based geospatial analysis.
* **Data Source**: Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery.
* **Spectral Analysis**: Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) with a threshold of $> 0.3$ to isolate submerged structures.
* **Visualization**: Interactive mapping using `geemap` and `folium`.

## 📖 Publication Details
* **Journal**: Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Graphics and Multimedia Technology.
* **Citation**: Kanakhara R.M., et al. (2025). *Unveiling the lost city: Satellite-based detection of underwater ruins in Dwarka.*
